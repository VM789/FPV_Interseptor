## About
"Predator" is a powerfull FPV drone that is designed to be assembled from cheap and accessible components. Especially I used trophy parts from russian FPV drone "Knaz Vandal Novgorodskiy" as a refense of popular trophy parts. The purpose of this project - make an affordable interceptor drone, which can be assembled mainly from trophy items, for the Ukrainian military.

## Key Features

- High-efficient aerodynamic form, based on NASA symetric airfoils
  
- Accessibility
  
- Speed
  
## Components:

- F405/H743 FC with BetaFlight support

- 3115 6S 900-1200kv motors (Brand isn't so important but very cheap can cause overheat)

- `ESC 55+A (but calibrate trottle limit in that case)` OR 4x 80 - 100A esc with 12s Matek pdb. In high-perfomance case i suggest you to use ESC from "Molniya 1/2", it's Skywalker 100A v2

- VTX - Caddx Walksnail moonlight for expensive version and 3.3ghz+ 2W+ analog VTX for cheap one. You can offer mount for youe model of VTX in issue page. So I prefer `AKK 3W 5.8Ghz` for start

- RX - I will desigh my own RX based on EBYTE rf modules, but for now i prefer simple `dual 915mhz RX`

- Camera - `Ratel pro` and JS 640X512 / 384X288 / 256X192  if you heed thermal camera (You can take it from "Knaz Vandal Novgorodskiy")
